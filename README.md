# Compsoft-Project-Internship-Healthcare-Chat-Bot
This is an internship project that aims to run a chatbot.
This is a chatbot made in reference to the healthcare chat bot by Aryan Vetuvalkar's one in the github repository

To run this chatbot, you need to have installed numpy, pandas and matplotlib
Run these codes in the cmd prompt to install them, if you haven't already:
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

To verify whether you have installed the code, please run these lines on the IDLE intepreter
import numpy
import pandas
import matplotlib

According to the original readme, run QuestionDiagonosisTkinter.py to run the programme, however if that doesn't work:

I'd suggest running the healthcare_chatbotConsole.py on google collab or any other similar software to get the output for medical symptoms and finding out about the right doctor.

The newlogin.py should show you the login screen if it runs on your python IDE.

As proof that we attempted the project and for convenience, please check the compsoft_technology_project_internship_health_care_chatbot.ipynb file on google colab
